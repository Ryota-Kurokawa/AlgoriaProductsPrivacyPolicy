# Privacy Policy

This Privacy Policy applies to the mobile application "Smart Subscription" (hereinafter referred to as "the App"), provided by Ryota Kurokawa (hereinafter referred to as "the Service Provider"). The App is provided as a free service and is intended for use "AS IS".

The App may collect the following information upon download and use:

- Your device's Internet Protocol (IP) address
- The pages you visit within the App, the date and time of your visit, and the time spent on those pages
- Your usage time of the App
- The operating system of your mobile device

The App does not collect the precise location information of your mobile device.

However, the Service Provider may collect your device's location information for the following purposes:

- **Location-based Services**:
  - To provide personalized content, relevant recommendations, and location-based services.
- **Analytics and Improvement**:
  - To analyze user behavior, identify trends, and improve the overall performance and functionality of the App using anonymized location data.
- **Third-party Services**:
  - To periodically transmit anonymized location data to external services for the purpose of improving and optimizing the App.

Furthermore, the Service Provider may contact you to provide important information, necessary notices, and marketing promotions.

To provide a better experience, the App may ask you to provide certain personally identifiable information, including but not limited to your email address, username, and phone number. This information will be used and stored as described in this Privacy Policy.

## Third-Party Disclosure

The Service Provider may periodically provide anonymized data to external services to improve the App and its services. We may also share your information in the following situations:

- When required by law (such as in response to a subpoena or similar legal process).
- When we believe in good faith that disclosure is necessary to protect our rights, ensure your safety, investigate fraud, or respond to a government request.
- When shared with trusted service providers (these providers do not have the right to use the information independently and have agreed to adhere to this Privacy Policy).

## Right to Opt-Out

You can stop all collection of information by the App easily by uninstalling it. You can use the standard uninstall processes available on your mobile device or via the mobile application marketplace or network.

## Data Retention Policy

Primarily, since we only use a local database, we do not retain the data you provide remotely. The Service Provider may retain user-provided data for as long as you use the App, and for a reasonable time thereafter. If you wish to have your data deleted, please contact us at `ryota1582.work@gmail.com`. We will respond within a reasonable time.

## Children's Privacy

The App is not intended for children under the age of 13, and we do not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from individuals under 13. In the case we discover that a child under 13 has provided us with personal information, we will immediately delete this from our servers. If you are a parent or guardian and you are aware that your child has provided us with personal information, please contact us at `ryota1582.work@gmail.com`.

## Security

The Service Provider implements physical, electronic, and procedural safeguards to protect the confidentiality of your information.

## Changes to This Privacy Policy

This Privacy Policy may be updated from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page. You are advised to review this Privacy Policy periodically for any changes. Your continued use of the App will be deemed as your acceptance of the modified Privacy Policy.
